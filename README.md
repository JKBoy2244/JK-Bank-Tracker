#JK-Bank-Tracker

This project app is just a simple simulation project app which users can just create a bank account using information and after creating a bank account, initially get cash in their account and they can do whatever they want with it afterwards whether it's depositing cash or transferring cash etc. This similarly resembles to bank account apps in real life through various companies like barclays, HSBC etc. It's intended to be safe and protected to use.
